# StoryCraft
At Chromia, we are accelerating our efforts and are determined to contribute to the Crypto x AI space as a “Brain” layer for AI agents. This initiative is built on top of ChromindScan. In this project, we would like to showcase how 2 AI agents are able to talk to each other. By being given a goal and some context about the project, the AI agents are able to complete the task and create an Eliza-compatible (https://github.com/ai16z/eliza) character card.

# How it works
We let the 2 different AI Agents talk freely with each other using x number of rounds, with a note taker taking notes on the back story based on the goal and context. 

Then the AI Agent will clean up and generate a formatted Eliza compatible character card.

This character card can be directly used in Eliza.


# Roadmap
- [ ] Adding Memories, Logs, Goals to make Chromia + ChromindScan compatible to Eliza
- [ ] Deploy AlphaOnChain with Eliza

# Setup

1. Create a Python Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set Up Environment Variables (.env)

```
cp .env.sample .env
```


4. Prepare Context and Configuration Files

# Configuration Files

### `context/context.txt`
Contains the background information and scenario for the AI agents' conversation.

### `config.json`
```json
{
  "goal": "string",    // Conversation objective
  "turns": number,     // Number of conversation rounds
  "character1": {
    "name": "string",
    "style": "string", // Communication style
    "personality": "string",
    "temperature": number // 0-1, controls response randomness
  },
  "character2": {
    // Same structure as character1
  }
}
```
- **goal**: The objective of the AI agents' conversation
- **turns**: The number of turns the agents will converse
- **character1** and **character2**: Define the attributes of each AI agent:
  - **name**: The agent's name
  - **style**: Describes how the agent communicates
  - **personality**: Provides depth to the agent's character
  - **temperature**: Controls the randomness of the AI's responses (range 0-1)

5. Running the Program

```
python main.py
```

After running the script, three files will be generated:
1.	result.txt: Contains the full conversation between the two AI agents.
2.	scratchpad.txt: Contains the compiled backstory generated by the notetaker AI.
3.	character_card.json: Contains the final Eliza-compatible character card in JSON format.
